        		<h1>Welcome to Guoqing's Webpage </h1>
				<p>About me </p>
I am currently an associate professor in School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Weihai, China. 
<br /> 
<br />
I received my PhD degree in Computer Applied Technology from East China Normal University, China, in 2015, under the supervision of Prof Shiliang Sun. I obtained my BS degrees from Xinyang Normal University, China, in 2009. From 2015 to 2017, I was a Postdoc Fellow in School of Engineering, University of Connecticut, USA, working with Prof Jinbo Bi. From 2017 to 2018, I was a Postdoc Fellow in Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, USA, working with Prof Yuan Luo. From 2018 to 2020, I was a Research Scientist in LARC of School of Information System, Singapore Management University, USA, working with Prof Ee-Peng Lim.I then joined Harbin Institute of Technology, China, where I am currently an associate professor.
<br />
<br />
My current research interests include machine learning, data mining, medical informatics, bioinformatics and service computing.
