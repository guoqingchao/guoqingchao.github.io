				<p>About me </p>
			I am currently a full professor in School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University, Qingdao, China. I am also with Institute of Intelligent Computing (IIC).

I received my PhD degree in Computer Science from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2015, under the supervision of Prof Jun Luo and Prof Ying He. I obtained my BS and MS degrees from Shandong Normal University, China, in 2007 and Shandong University, China, in 2010, respectively. From 2014 to 2015, I was a Research Fellow in School of Computing, National University of Singapore, Singapore, working with Prof Seth Gilbert and Prof Mun Choon Chan. I then joined Shandong University, China, where I am currently a professor. I received several Best Paper Awards from IEEE IPCCC 2020, IIKI 2019 and CSoNet 2019. I also received 2020 ACM China SIGAPP Rising Star Award due to the contribution in sensor networks, Internet of Things and their applications.

My current research interests include distributed algorithms/systems, wireless networking, mobile sensing/computing, edge computing and Internet of Things.
