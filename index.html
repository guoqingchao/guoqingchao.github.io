        		<h1>Welcome to Guoqing's Webpage </h1>
				<p><b>About me</b> </p>
Guoqing Chao is currently an associate professor in School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Weihai, China. 
<br /> 
<br />
He received his PhD degree in Computer Applied Technology from East China Normal University, China, in 2015, under the supervision of Prof Shiliang Sun. He obtained his BS degrees from Xinyang Normal University, China, in 2009. From 2015 to 2017, he was a Postdoc Fellow in School of Engineering, University of Connecticut, USA, working with Prof Jinbo Bi. From 2017 to 2018, he was a Postdoc Fellow in Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, USA, working with Prof Yuan Luo. From 2018 to 2020, he was a Research Scientist in LARC of School of Information System, Singapore Management University, USA, working with Prof Ee-Peng Lim. He then joined Harbin Institute of Technology, China, where he is currently an associate professor.
<br />
<br />
His current research interests include machine learning, data mining, medical informatics, bioinformatics and service computing.
