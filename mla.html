This session aims to provide a platform for researchers and engineers from machine learning, automation-intelligence to communicate the development of machine learning theory and their applications especially related to automation-intelligence.
<br />
Although multi-view representation learning has gained great progress, there are still some open problems that requires further investigation. For instance, most existing  multi-view representation learning methods can not deal with missing values and unaligned views directly. Big data era calls for efficient multi-view representation learning methods. Deep multi-view representation learning methods have huge parameters to tune and lack interpretability. Compared with other machine learning tasks like classification, multi-view representation learning does not have a clear criterion or good evaluation. All these problems call for novel multi-view representation learning theory and algorithms.
<br />
	<ul>
Topics of interest will be focused on, but not limited to:
<br />
<li>Supervised and unsupervised learning methods (including classification, regression, clustering, representation learning,  etc.)</li>

<li>Semi-supervised learning, Ensemble methods, Multi-view learning, Multi-task learning, Multi-source learning, Multi-label learning, Multi-instance learning, Transfer learning,</li>

<li>Generative model (Variational autoencoder, Generative Adversarial Network, Diffusion Models), Deep learning methods  (Convolutional Neural Network, Graph Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory, Transformer)</li>

<li>Natural language processing (GPT, question answering, machine translation)</li>

<li>Computer vision(Human Activity Recognition, Human Pose Estimation, Object detection, Image Segmentation)</li>

<li>Speech processing and Multi-modal learning</li>
</ul>
<br  />
